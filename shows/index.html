      <article>
        <p>A favourite of Christchurch audiences for over twenty years, Scared Scriptless combines fast-paced, off-the-cuff theatre with just the right amount of audience interaction and the Court Jesters’ own brand of razor-sharp wit.

        <p>
          <b>
            Scared Scriptless plays every Friday and Saturday night (except public holidays, with a short hiatus over the Christmas/New Year period). To book, call the Box Office on 963 0870, or

          <h3>Radio Ha Ha</h3>
          <p>A rapid-fire, off-the-cuff 1930s radio show shaped entirely around audience suggestions to create news, interviews and thrilling serials that never seen – or heard – before. Packed with thrills and spills and complete with live sound effects and music, this loving homage to the golden age of the wireless proved so popular that it was aired on Radio NZ National.</p>

          <h3>Aunty McDuff's Magical Trunk</h3>
          <p>Ever wondered what your mad old aunty keeps in her trunk? For the three kids in AUNTY MCDUFF’S MAGICAL TRUNK, it’s everything they need to escape the boredom of a rainy day and get carried away on a magical adventure that has them cruising the world in a boat or a plane, defending castles, or riding in wagon trains with cowboys and indians! No two shows are the same as the audience help decide what happens next in a unique adventure in storytelling using the magic of imagination.</p>

          <h3>Chatterbox</h3>
          <p>The stars of today are lampooned by the stars of tomorrow as The Court Jesters get up close and personal with local celebrities. After a live interview with Artistic Director Ross Gumbley, four of our top improvisers replay stories from the lives and careers of these famous Cantabrians. Guests include Garry Moore, Margaret Mahy, Steve Gurney, David McPhail and Ruth Dyson.</p>

          <h3>Scriptless Uncut</h3>
          <p>With the glitz and glamour of a Hollywood awards ceremony, The Jesters romp across genres, styles and the bounds of political correctness to create anything from art-house, melodrama and independent film to schlock horror, science fiction and big-budget blockbusters, armed with only their wits (and audience suggestions) to guide them. SCRIPTLESS UNCUT is a love letter to an industry that shoots too many pictures and not enough actors.</p>

          <h3>The New Adventures of Auntie McDuff’s Magical Trunk</h3>
          <p>Auntie McDuff’s Magical Trunk is back after a successful Kidsfest season in 2008, ready to take audiences on a completely new magical adventure! Using only the old objects in mad Auntie McDuff’s Trunk, three actors set off on an exciting and wonderfully old-fashioned ride – building everything they need along the way!</p>

          <h3>Pulp William</h3>
          <p>Three performers break out of their cages after being locked up with Shakespeare’s Complete Works and a set of Tarantino DVDs to create a unique mix of star-crossed lovers, bad-ass gangsters, Mexican stand-offs, Italian surnames, cunning plots, poison, handguns, sonnets and fast-paced dialogue laden with pop culture references and extended metaphors – all in a plot with more twists than a night at Jack Rabbit Slims. It’s an improvised comedy mash-up that blows audiences away.</p>

          <h3>A Very Merry Scriptless</h3>
          <p>Masters of improvised mayhem The Court Jesters gave their fast-paced, furiously funny brand of comedy a festive feel in A Very Merry Scriptless, with content suitable for the whole family. This holiday-themed improvised show is a theatrical Christmas cracker for all ages.</p>
          <p>In 2006 the show followed a fun format of short scenes in the traditional SCRIPTLESS style. In 2007 it was a “Celebrity Christmas Special” hosted by Scott Koorey. In 2008 the Jesters took on Scrooge with an improvised reinterpretation of Dickens’ CHRISTMAS CAROL. In 2009 they took on the Nativity itself.</p>
