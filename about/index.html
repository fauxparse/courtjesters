      <h2>A little bit of history…</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Theatre Sports™ was first introduced to Christchurch in 1987, and a number of enthusiasts were early adapters. With the philosophy of just ‘giving it a go’, Scared Scriptless first took to the Court Theatre stage in December of 1990 at the late night Friday timeslot of 11pm.The show found a voice that suited the hour, and with that an audience. A number of well-known Kiwi entertainers honed their improv skills at Scared Scriptless, including Greg Cooper, Cal Wilson, Ross Gumbley, KC Kelly, and the late Kevin Smith. In 1994, the Court Jesters took on 16 of the world’s best Theatre Sports teams, and were crowned World Champions.</p>
        <p>In 2006, with the show now a Christchurch institution, a larger audience was introduced to Scared Scriptless when it was brought forward to 10pm under new manager Kirsty Gillespie. This led to regular sell-out shows, so in 2010 a second weekly show was added to Saturdays. Today The Court Jesters are proud to claim Scared Scriptless as Australasia’s longest-running comedy show.</p>
        <p>In addition to Scared Scriptless, the Court Jesters also perform over 100 shows a year off-site, deploying their unique brand of quick-thinking comedy and professionalism to entertain at corporate events, parties and conferences.</p>
